# üöÄ Machine Translation Using Transformers

## üìò Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a **Transformer-based Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system** for **English-to-Hindi translation**. Transformers, with their self-attention mechanisms and parallelized sequence processing capabilities, have become the state-of-the-art approach in machine translation, surpassing traditional RNN and LSTM-based models.  

The goal of this project is to design and train a robust translation model that can effectively capture the **syntactic, semantic, and contextual nuances** across English and Hindi, producing **fluent, contextually relevant, and grammatically accurate translations**.

## üìä Dataset
We utilize the **English-Hindi Parallel Corpus** provided by Preet Viradiya on Kaggle. This dataset contains **130,000+ parallel sentence pairs**, collected from diverse domains to ensure robust linguistic coverage.  

**Key dataset features:**
- Over **130k English-Hindi sentence pairs**
- Data sourced from **web scraping and curated resources**
- Balanced representation of **formal and informal contexts**
- Suitable for **training and benchmarking Translation Models**

## üîß Model Architecture
The model is built upon the **Transformer architecture**, originally proposed in *‚ÄúAttention Is All You Need‚Äù (Vaswani et al., 2017)*. It eliminates sequence-aligned recurrence and convolution, relying entirely on attention mechanisms.

**Core Components:**
- **Encoder**: Encodes the English input sentence into a sequence of contextual embeddings.  
- **Decoder**: Uses both the encoder output and self-attention to generate Hindi translations step by step.  
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Captures dependencies across different positions in the sequence.  
- **Positional Encoding**: Provides information about word order in a sequence.  
- **Feedforward Layers**: Apply transformations to enrich contextual representations.  

This architecture‚Äôs **parallelized computation and ability to model long-range dependencies** make it highly effective for translation tasks.

## üß™ Training & Evaluation
**Training Procedure:**
- **Preprocessing**: Sentence normalization, tokenization (using Byte-Pair Encoding or SentencePiece), and vocabulary construction.  
- **Optimization**: Trained using the **Adam optimizer** with learning rate scheduling (warm-up steps).  
- **Regularization**: Dropout, label smoothing, and gradient clipping to prevent overfitting.  
- **Batching**: Dynamic padding with masked attention to handle variable-length sentences efficiently.  

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **BLEU Score**: Primary metric for translation quality evaluation.  
- **Perplexity**: Used to assess the model‚Äôs predictive performance.  
- **Human Evaluation (Optional)**: For evaluating fluency and adequacy beyond numerical scores.

## ‚úÖ Expected Outcome
The trained Transformer model will be capable of producing **high-quality, fluent Hindi translations** for English input sentences, with performance measured against standard benchmarks. This system can serve as the foundation for **multilingual NLP applications** such as chatbots, educational platforms, cross-lingual search engines, and low-resource language translation systems.
